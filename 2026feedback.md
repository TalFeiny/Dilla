score 51/100

please youve messed up the page dimensions. please go over this and ggive a rethink, 

1. wasted slide and cut off
2. scoribg matrix is cool but not sure how its determined. plus, theres a duplicate and the labels are cut off
3. generic scoring and text, seems just pass regardless, just haardocded. valuation seems a bit low ut revenue fair. looks like json dump. tells us nothing
4. team is v good but why quality score 0
5. path to 100m chart doesnt appear. sad cos this used to be a good slide
6. detailed product slide but poorly layed out. numbers arent readable.
7. exit prob cloud doesnt appear
8. Breakpoints. a few things wrong with this graph. i think it works but the numbers overlap each other and there no blue line fro with pro rata. im unsure if the maths is right but it seems solid
9. exit scenarios, empty no graph rendered
10. this sankey is pretty cool but it needs to be clearer but yeah very cool, doesnt tell us enough tho, im not 100% sure whats the prices actually mean
11. follow on missing. 
12. investment recommendations tho on slide 3 missing. 
13. predictove round intel is good but some parts seem hardocded and it could be explained clearer. and be ore specifc in the time based analysis - how long since it raised, revenue step what does it need etc. 
14. recommendations empty
15 sources there.

pdf does a basic screenshot thats empty. there isnt even a deck. work on it properly
