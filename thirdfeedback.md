Slide 1 - its fine but i dont like the font maybe we need to pay for a better one
Slide 2 -  It picked the wrong vega. lets exclude israel from all the list as it is pariah. and the revenue muultiple anyway doesnt make sense but i guess if a stealth company thats fine
Slide 3 -  the founders slide adds no value cos its not getting any data. we actually want the founders name and work history really with a linkedin links clikable for each. saying 'no technical founder' but theres no evidence. looks very 'AI' too
Slide 4 -  ARR projection shows one straight line for one and one j curve for another. also the growth rates are inferred correctly yes but they need to account for the actual exit scenarios and company quality and be transparent aabout assumptions of traectory. all lines need to be curves and it really depends on company quality
Slide 5 - this one is p good except the pricing models are guessed
Slide 6 - this slide is just some dumped bars that make 0 sense
Slide 7 - TAM FAILED IS HARDCODED. IT SEEMED TO PARTTIALLY BUT NOT FULLY IDNEITYF ONE MARKET BUT DIDNT DO THE TAM SEARCH
sLIDE 8 & 9 - tHIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE CAP TABLE WORKED SO WELL DONE, BUT IT PROBS SHOULD BE A PIE OR REALLY SANKEY. ALSO IT DOESNT STIPULATE THE EXIT AND PREFERENCES WHICH IS APROBLEM
sLIDE 10- YOU TOOK LITERALLY THAT I WANTED A SLIDE ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF 150 EXITS. THIS IS NEVER WHAT I ASKED FOR. I WANTED A FULL SHOW OF THE BREAKPOINTS
SLIDE 11-13 NOTHING APPEARS
sLIDE 14, NOT SURE THE ONWERSHIP CALCULATIONS ARE GOOD. 
FINAL TAKE - CORRECT TOO LATE BUT THE CASE WASNT MADE WELL ENOUGH
