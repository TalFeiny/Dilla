Anam and endex
Slide 1 - just intro - needs better design
Slide 2- Pretty good comparison. Anam revenue a bit high. sceptical of how adjusted the revenue is. valuations seem alright maybe. 
Slide 3- Founder a team analysis is dummy- didnt find anything
Slide 4 - its a good slide but im not sure its actually right. shows almost infinite growth for anam at 200% arr with no account for decacy, and endex growing at 50% but just assumes constant. so huge delta between them. it ends anam at 1.4b arr and endex on 100, which is strange and not really that helpful. even if those were thwe growth rates, anam is a smaller number, no idea why anam is a j curve and endex a straight line.
Slide 5 - Business analysis slide p good. not sure about the sector catgorisation for Endex, correct for anam. it says 'fintech analytics' when it should really be AI agents for Fintech, and this shows downstream

Slide 6 - Valuation compariso n graph a bit pointless tbh, it should tell us something or not be there
slide 7- TAM slide, each shows different but honestly no actual sector or transparent logic applied. probs dummy and has failed. 0 transparency or catgeory defined. must be dummy
Slide 8 - Anam dilution seems realistic but its too founder focused. doesnt tell us anything as investors
Slide 9 - Endex dilution doesnt infer rounds and is completely wrong
Slide 10-12 - empty cap table and waterfall. numbers for ownership stake and founder ownership seem wrong. loads of charts empty. not sure the liq pref math is right. or the next round founder ownership but maybe on a diluted basis it makes sense. 4% at series C seems low. same as 24% by A. Also the follow on numbers dont really make sense because it needs to show pro rata round size to maintain onwership, not ownership with follow on. also not sure the breakpoints are right and account for full pref stack
entry an exit are different to points stated in other parts of the deck

DPI slide - conceptualy right but no showing other companies. alsoi the scale looks weird and should show both companies side by side. could do with some work.

Slide 11 and beyond. completely empty other than fund fit with some hardcoded companies (not even the companies used) all. it doesnt even make much sense because how could the same cheque get more ownership in a series B company than a seed company.
