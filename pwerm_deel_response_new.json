The startup, which offers global payroll and other services to companies around the world, was valued at $12 billion at the time of its last raise, although its current valuation is not known. It operates with a SaaS business model, meaning that it charges a subscription fee for its software.

[...] Bouaziz also today confirmed the company’s valuation of $12 billion, which we reported on in May at the time of Deel’s $50 million raise. At the time, Deel did not confirm that valuation, apparently choosing to wait until it had full-year ARR numbers to share. [...] The massive jump in ARR is impressive by normal standards but particularly so considering the challenging macroenvironment that startups everywhere faced last year. Deel says it calculates ARR as monthly recurring SaaS revenues x 12.
