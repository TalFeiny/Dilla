[...] Amid a flurry of public offerings from the likes of Webull, Chime, Circle Internet Group, Robinhood Markets, and SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI), financial services unicorn Stripe has remained a private company. But with a reported valuation of $91.5 billion, Stripe exceeds the market capitalizations of incumbent fintech businesses such as PayPal and Block by a considerable margin. [...] Overall, I think the results have largely been mixed for public offerings in the fintech sector in recent years.\n\nI think a big reason for this performance is that despite impressive growth and differentiated product offerings, questions remain over how neobanks and new brokerage platforms can really compete and disrupt industry incumbents.",
