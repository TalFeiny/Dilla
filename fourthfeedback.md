Slide 1. - 
slide 2 - this slide only appears in in app - the revenue multiples arent right, and trig revenue should be higher, fund ownership is 365 % not even possible. nonsense numbers 
Slide 3 - side by side company - in the in app this is an empty slide - it actually looks ok in the pdf and appears however Trig stage is wrong. trig has raised a seed so is a seed company. revenue is too close. we need to sort if stage means what theyve raised or what theyre ready to raise. Claimy only done a preseed so how can they be the same. 
Slide 4 - in app this is team slide, doesnt exist in pdf. font is tacky nd llm looking. we got founders which is good, no mention of work history, no inferred team size. hardocded lean team for seed, no technical cofudner not even true
Slide 5 - Graph looks fine but the axis dont make sense. y axis goes it goes 1-60, and we want actual current date on the x axis. also the numbers dont really make sense and everyone has 200% yoy growth. its justy too basic and numbers dont really tell us much helpful
Slide 6 - business analysis - this is fine no tam tho, and in the pdf we have the market defined. it makes up Revenuetech which doesnt make any sense. also missing in web version the pricing model. says one is transaction based so need to check actually. 
Slide 7 -  grouped bar not supported - im not even sure what it is
slide 8 - TAM slide, makes calculations, but it hasnt defined the market, doesnt even say what the market is, how the numbers are calucted sources and how the market is defined, really poor
Slide 9 - Trig cap table. pretty cool that it got the investors but the chart is a mess, also doesnt appear in pdf version. numbers are wrong. unclear what the y axis is. and shouldnt be a bar chart. not a suitable chart for this, it also used to show dilution and % ownership, need a different chart type and also future cap table with our stake and dilution, we used to have this, just shows exit, no future rounds 
Slide 10-  Claimy - didnt get any investors for this. same applies but fallback did ok, same as 9
slide 11 - side by side cap table doesnt render
Slide 12 - exit scenarios - this chart type is cool but doesnt really work, and it says return in $ which doesnt make sense. also not what i had in mind. and its tiny, with another breakpoint chart crammed and empty, the exit scenarios dont make sense. and doesnt render in pdf. its just a mess loads of empoty charts. and why 10% ownership hardocded. i dont trust the numbers, i dont think the breakpoint are right cos they dont take into account future rounds. that was the purpose of the probablity cloud. i think its just hardcoded
slide 13 - dpi, uses old fund context and still doesnt really make sense or tell us anything. this needs work, and not in pdf
Slide 14 - follow on - hardcoded nonsense slide
slide 15 - recommendations - doesnt make sense. uses the ownership but again obsessed with 10% and also seems to have hardocded pass and reasons for it. it een is red and says pass and then at the same time says schedule a meeting. come on man
slide 16 - citations, empty in app shows in pdf but some irrelevant citations. 

Discrepnacies - mostly 9-15 missing slides in pdf - and pdf is nicer style than in app. many charts not rendering, loads of missing slides. whole thing needs to look less ai, and use a consistent style


Analysis of the actual companies like analyst grade not really happening, just doing some bad maths and shit charts rn. need to go further to actually tell us something insifghtul.
