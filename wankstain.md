  4. Other Improvements

> and based on things ive said in here

⏺ Based on your feedback here and in sevenheavenfeedback.md, here's the complete list of what needs fixing:

  Critical Issues You've Mentioned:

  1. Style Consistency (YOUR MAIN COMPLAINT)

  - ✅ DONE: Removed purple/green colors → neo noir dark grays
  - ✅ DONE: Removed tacky checkmarks from founders slide
  - STILL NEEDED: Apply consistent styling to EVERY page in the app (not just deck)
  - STILL NEEDED: Professional typography throughout

  2. TAM Citations (YOU SAID: "just dumps a TAM number with no evidence")

  - ✅ PARTIALLY DONE: Improved citation extraction
  - STILL NEEDED: Perplexity-style clickable citations with [1][2][3] numbers
  - STILL NEEDED: Actual source URLs that link to evidence
  - STILL NEEDED: Show which category was selected and WHY

  3. PDF Export Quality (YOU SAID: "embarrassing and complex charts won't render")

  - STILL NEEDED: Fix Sankey chart rendering (Slide 11)
  - STILL NEEDED: Fix probability cloud "invalid chart structure" (Slide 12)
  - STILL NEEDED: Split overcrowded slides

  Remaining Issues from Feedback:

  Slide-by-Slide Fixes Needed:

  Slide 2 (Executive Summary):
  - Add pre/post money valuations
  - Fix duplicate 150% growth rates
  - Show why both companies have 0.7x return

  Slide 5 (Path to $100M):
  - Add time since funding rounds
  - Show ownership evolution after each dilution round

  Slide 7 (Market Dynamics):
  - Remove empty sections
  - Show ACV rationale
  - Fix gross margin display

  Slide 9 (Cap Table):
  - Make forward-looking with OUR potential ownership
  - Fix empty text sections

  Slide 12 (Exit Scenarios):
  - Split probability cloud to separate slide
  - Fix "invalid chart structure" error

  Slide 13 (DPI):
  - Use actual fund context ($234M fund, $125M deployed)
  - Not just empty calculations

  Slide 14 (Follow-on):
  - Remove hardcoded generic text
  - Use actual scenario data

  Slide 16 (Citations):
  - Add actual clickable URLs
  - Not empty citation list

  Global Issues:

  - No actual scoring/analysis - just displays data without insights
  - Hardcoded values throughout instead of calculated
  - Empty/duplicate slides that add no value

  The main theme: The app looks unprofessional with inconsistent styling, dumps numbers without evidence, and has broken/empty 
  visualizations.
LOOK G. in an ideal world, we want this "@Rillet and @v7" it categorises as accounting software, simple search query. but it should intelligenty know its in a space with some VC kings, like light, puzzle, pigment, but its really mid market fast growing erp, with some enterprise. so it finds accounting erp software, finds a few sources, with numbers url and maybe cagr or "x by 2034", then does the pincer bottom up, top down technique, but obviously this is looking to unsuite netsuite, oraclle)) sage etc, so how much can it realistically take (needs analysis) - then v7 is more difficult, it comes up as image computer vison ai, but its horizontal, so you would categorise enteprise ai horizontal image ai --- obvs GM analysis accordingly, it mentions high volume of documents, needs to analyse, its a hot coimpany growing fast but you need to pull a report on image ai, then adjust that its enteprise - find some reports with market size estimates use em cite em, analyse the market structure - V7 horixontal gen ai has model / open ai / anthro risk but also has sticky enterprise contracts
