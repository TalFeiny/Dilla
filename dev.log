Across\nthe UK, Gen Z\u2019s and Millennials use the term, \u201cMonzo it\u201d to describe sending money.\nThe UK banking market is saturated, yet large enough to support multiple growing unicorn\nstartups. While others like Revolut have vied to become a superapp, Monzo stayed true to\nits core strengths to get to net profitability. Now it is tasked with growing horizontally and\nexpanding its core offering into new markets.\n\u25cf\nMonzo is growing at 162% YOY. This is only beaten by Alicia and Moneybox in\nEurope. It is higher than Revolut (95%) and Starling (51%). It did 1.1B$ in revenue.\n\u25cf\nMonzo has 10M customers in the UK. It is looking to expand into Europe and make a\nsecond attempt at the US market. It recorded a 91% growth in business accounts\nopened. Monzo had a 37% customer growth rate to Revolut\u2019s 45%. Not bad for a\nbusiness with a narrower product and geography range.\n\u25cf\nNet Interest Income increased 167% on 88% increase in deposits. While this may\nlook synthetic, the UK\u2019s wage pressures appear to make this look like a resolute form\nof income in the medium term as rates stay high. Particularly, as Treasury\ninvestments made when base rates were 1% are reinvested.\n\u25cf\nNet Fee and Commission based income increased by 54% to \u00a3204.8M. This comes\nfrom a combination of growth in customer spending in the UK, alongside subscription\nrevenue from both business and consumer premium products.\n\u25cf\nCredit Losses growing around 25% reflective of over doubling the amount lent to\ncustomers.\n\u25cf\nPersonnel expenses up 47% due to key hires like CFO, while operating expenses up\n56% due to card production expenses and payment processing fees.\n\u25cf\n\u00a38.7M net profit means that Monzo won\u2019t have to raise again.\nValuation\n\u25cf\nMonzo recently raised an institutional secondary round where common stock from\ncurrent employees was sold at a \u00a34.5B (5.9B$) valuation.\n\u25cf\nThis was after two consecutive primary raises at a post money valuation of \u00a34.1B\n(5.2B$) valuation.\n\u25cf\nMonzo\u2019s founders are all cashed out of the business, yet founding ex-employees\nwere not allowed to participate leading to them signing a petition. This is particularly\n\n\n---\n\n## Page 2\n\nunusual given that in secondaries in Moneybox, GoCardless, Vinted & Revolut, ex\nemployees took part.\n\u25cf\nThe sell ask is \u00a313 (16.5$) per share, valuing Monzo at 4.73B$ (\u00a33.7B). That\u2019s a\n20% discount to the secondary, and a 9% to the last primary valuation.\nThe Deal\n\u25cf\nWe know Monzo is unlikely to accept such a discount. In fact, their position is\ncurrently blocking all transfers.\n\u25cf\nThis is clearly unsustainable. The business is not ready to go public yet \u2014 the\nsecondary round is an admission of such.\n\u25cf\nProtecting valuations has limits, when there are angry ex employees who need\nliquidity. This is a fight that is winnable.\n\u25cf\nRevolut took the same restrictive position on stock transfers, while eventually caving.\n\u25cf\nThere are many creative means of negotiating and campaigning for companies to \u2018let\nmy people go.\u2019\n\u25cf\nMonzo has hired the Ex Nubank CFO, which means it will likely list on the LSE in the\nnext few years. Its numbers are not currently good enough to do so.\n\u25cf\nMonzo\u2019s numbers are already likely vastly improved for 2024 to justify the new\nsecondary valuation. Since it has raised over 1.7B$, there should be a discount\nregardless of this, due to the preference.\n\u25cf\nIt\u2019s easy to see a world in a few years time where Monzo lists with revenue over $2B,\nand widening net profitability closer to Starling and Revolut, fetching a much higher\nvaluation in the process.\n\u25cf\nTo put that journey into perspective, look at Wise. As a public company, it is\ncontinuing to grow at 20%, with profits increasing 55%. Fintechs will continue to\nreduce operating costs with AI agents over time. Wise trades at over 10X revenues,\nwith a Net Profit similar to Starling and Revolut, underscoring the ability for Monzo to\nfetch a strong valuation when it does reach the public markets.\nCleo AI\nWhen the enigmatic Barney Hussey-Yeo founded an AI chatbot for budgeting in 2016, he\ntook the bold step to pivot to the US market. That gamble paid off. Today, Cleo does $150M\nof revenue, with a stronghold in the US, and sights on the UK.\nYou\u2019re likely wondering how a chatbot can win in the era of LLMs, but Barney understood the\nvalue of conversational interfaces way before it went mainstream. Now, with an armada of\nloyal subscribers, Cleo is expanding into building customers\u2019 an alternative credit score and\nproviding credit\n\n\n---\n\n## Page 3\n\n\u25cf\nCleo did $65.9M of revenue in 2023, growing that to around 150M$ in 2024,\naccording to a company document. That\u2019s 127% growth.\n\u25cf\nThey brought losses down to just over $14M, reaching EBITDA breakeven in\nDecember 2023. For 2024, they will likely generate a significant net profit.\n\u25cf\nAround 61% of its revenues come from its three subscription products including\nbudgeting and credit builder, with the rest coming from transaction fees.\n\u25cf\nIn 2023, all of its revenue was from the US, with reentrance of the UK on the horizon\nfor 2024.\n\u25cf\nYeo cited, higher conversion and utilisation\u201d of its paying products and \u201cimproved\nsubscriber retention,\u201d as key drivers of its increasing unit economics\u2019 efficiency.\nValuation\n\u25cf\nCleo last raised $83M in 2022 at a $500M valuation. It is unlikely to have to raise\nagain.\n\u25cf\nIt does not appear to have raised secondaries, although the founder is angel\ninvesting indicating he may have sold some stock recently.\n\u25cf\nDue to the obvious risks of consumer subscription revenue and LLM defensibility,\nthere is opportunity for a discount.\n\u25cf\nIt is likely that a deal could be struck at 650-750M$.\n\u25cf\nThe founder still owns the business, while there are sellers directly connected with\nthe founder to push the deal through fast.\n\u25cf\nThere is a path to an IPO or secondary market growth with expansion of product\nrange, leveraging proprietary data. However, trade acquirers have bought businesses\nlike this before, with Intuit buying Credit Karma for $7B, or Apple buying Credit Kudos\nfor $150M.\nOther Opportunities\n\u25cf\nHelsing - German Defence Tech\n\u25cf\nMarshmallow - UK Insurtech with over $500M ARR\n\n\n---\n\n"

Across\nthe UK, Gen Z\u2019s and Millennials use the term, \u201cMonzo it\u201d to describe sending money.\nThe UK banking market is saturated, yet large enough to support multiple growing unicorn\nstartups. While others like Revolut have vied to become a superapp, Monzo stayed true to\nits core strengths to get to net profitability. Now it is tasked with growing horizontally and\nexpanding its core offering into new markets.\n\u25cf\nMonzo is growing at 162% YOY. This is only beaten by Alicia and Moneybox in\nEurope. It is higher than Revolut (95%) and Starling (51%). It did 1.1B$ in revenue.\n\u25cf\nMonzo has 10M customers in the UK. It is looking to expand into Europe and make a\nsecond attempt at the US market. It recorded a 91% growth in business accounts\nopened. Monzo had a 37% customer growth rate to Revolut\u2019s 45%. Not bad for a\nbusiness with a narrower product and geography range.\n\u25cf\nNet Interest Income increased 167% on 88% increase in deposits. While this may\nlook synthetic, the UK\u2019s wage pressures appear to make this look like a resolute form\nof income in the medium term as rates stay high. Particularly, as Treasury\ninvestments made when base rates were 1% are reinvested.\n\u25cf\nNet Fee and Commission based income increased by 54% to \u00a3204.8M. This comes\nfrom a combination of growth in customer spending in the UK, alongside subscription\nrevenue from both business and consumer premium products.\n\u25cf\nCredit Losses growing around 25% reflective of over doubling the amount lent to\ncustomers.\n\u25cf\nPersonnel expenses up 47% due to key hires like CFO, while operating expenses up\n56% due to card production expenses and payment processing fees.\n\u25cf\n\u00a38.7M net profit means that Monzo won\u2019t have to raise again.\nValuation\n\u25cf\nMonzo recently raised an institutional secondary round where common stock from\ncurrent employees was sold at a \u00a34.5B (5.9B$) valuation.\n\u25cf\nThis was after two consecutive primary raises at a post money valuation of \u00a34.1B\n(5.2B$) valuation.\n\u25cf\nMonzo\u2019s founders are all cashed out of the business, yet founding ex-employees\nwere not allowed to participate leading to them signing a petition. This is particularly\n\n\n---\n\n## Page 2\n\nunusual given that in secondaries in Moneybox, GoCardless, Vinted & Revolut, ex\nemployees took part.\n\u25cf\nThe sell ask is \u00a313 (16.5$) per share, valuing Monzo at 4.73B$ (\u00a33.7B). That\u2019s a\n20% discount to the secondary, and a 9% to the last primary valuation.\nThe Deal\n\u25cf\nWe know Monzo is unlikely to accept such a discount. In fact, their position is\ncurrently blocking all transfers.\n\u25cf\nThis is clearly unsustainable. The business is not ready to go public yet \u2014 the\nsecondary round is an admission of such.\n\u25cf\nProtecting valuations has limits, when there are angry ex employees who need\nliquidity. This is a fight that is winnable.\n\u25cf\nRevolut took the same restrictive position on stock transfers, while eventually caving.\n\u25cf\nThere are many creative means of negotiating and campaigning for companies to \u2018let\nmy people go.\u2019\n\u25cf\nMonzo has hired the Ex Nubank CFO, which means it will likely list on the LSE in the\nnext few years. Its numbers are not currently good enough to do so.\n\u25cf\nMonzo\u2019s numbers are already likely vastly improved for 2024 to justify the new\nsecondary valuation. Since it has raised over 1.7B$, there should be a discount\nregardless of this, due to the preference.\n\u25cf\nIt\u2019s easy to see a world in a few years time where Monzo lists with revenue over $2B,\nand widening net profitability closer to Starling and Revolut, fetching a much higher\nvaluation in the process.\n\u25cf\nTo put that journey into perspective, look at Wise. As a public company, it is\ncontinuing to grow at 20%, with profits increasing 55%. Fintechs will continue to\nreduce operating costs with AI agents over time. Wise trades at over 10X revenues,\nwith a Net Profit similar to Starling and Revolut, underscoring the ability for Monzo to\nfetch a strong valuation when it does reach the public markets.\nCleo AI\nWhen the enigmatic Barney Hussey-Yeo founded an AI chatbot for budgeting in 2016, he\ntook the bold step to pivot to the US market.

Across\nthe UK, Gen Z’s and Millennials use the term, “Monzo it” to describe sending money.\nThe UK banking market is saturated, yet large enough to support multiple growing unicorn\nstartups. While others like Revolut have vied to become a superapp, Monzo stayed true to\nits core strengths to get to net profitability. Now it is tasked with growing horizontally and\nexpanding its core offering into new markets.\n●\nMonzo is growing at 162% YOY. This is only beaten by Alicia and Moneybox in\nEurope. It is higher than Revolut (95%) and Starling (51%). It did 1.1B$ in revenue.\n●\nMonzo has 10M customers in the UK. It is looking to expand into Europe and make a\nsecond attempt at the US market. It recorded a 91% growth in business accounts\nopened. Monzo had a 37% customer growth rate to Revolut’s 45%. Not bad for a\nbusiness with a narrower product and geography range.\n●\nNet Interest Income increased 167% on 88% increase in deposits.

Across\nthe UK, Gen Z’s and Millennials use the term, “Monzo it” to describe sending money.\nThe UK banking market is saturated, yet large enough to support multiple growing unicorn\nstartups. While others like Revolut have vied to become a superapp, Monzo stayed true to\nits core strengths to get to net profitability. Now it is tasked with growing horizontally and\nexpanding its core offering into new markets.\n●\nMonzo is growing at 162% YOY. This is only beaten by Alicia and Moneybox in\nEurope. It is higher than Revolut (95%) and Starling (51%). It did 1.1B$ in revenue.\n●\nMonzo has 10M customers in the UK. It is looking to expand into Europe and make a\nsecond attempt at the US market. It recorded a 91% growth in business accounts\nopened. Monzo had a 37% customer growth rate to Revolut’s 45%.

Across\nthe UK, Gen Z’s and Millennials use the term, “Monzo it” to describe sending money.\nThe UK banking market is saturated, yet large enough to support multiple growing unicorn\nstartups. While others like Revolut have vied to become a superapp, Monzo stayed true to\nits core strengths to get to net profitability. Now it is tasked with growing horizontally and\nexpanding its core offering into new markets.\n●\nMonzo is growing at 162% YOY. This is only beaten by Alicia and Moneybox in\nEurope. It is higher than Revolut (95%) and Starling (51%). It did 1.1B$ in revenue.\n●\nMonzo has 10M customers in the UK. It is looking to expand into Europe and make a\nsecond attempt at the US market. It recorded a 91% growth in business accounts\nopened. Monzo had a 37% customer growth rate to Revolut’s 45%. Not bad for a\nbusiness with a narrower product and geography range.\n●\nNet Interest Income increased 167% on 88% increase in deposits. While this may\nlook synthetic, the UK’s wage pressures appear to make this look like a resolute form\nof income in the medium term as rates stay high. Particularly, as Treasury\ninvestments made when base rates were 1% are reinvested.\n●\nNet Fee and Commission based income increased by 54% to £204.8M. This comes\nfrom a combination of growth in customer spending in the UK, alongside subscription\nrevenue from both business and consumer premium products.\n●\nCredit Losses growing around 25% reflective of over doubling the amount lent to\ncustomers.\n●\nPersonnel expenses up 47% due to key hires like CFO, while operating expenses up\n56% due to card production expenses and payment processing fees.\n●\n£8.7M net profit means that Monzo won’t have to raise again.\nValuation\n●\nMonzo recently raised an institutional secondary round where common stock from\ncurrent employees was sold at a £4.5B (5.9B$) valuation.\n●\nThis was after two consecutive primary raises at a post money valuation of £4.1B\n(5.2B$) valuation.\n●\nMonzo’s founders are all cashed out of the business, yet founding ex-employees\nwere not allowed to participate leading to them signing a petition. This is particularly\n\n\n---\n\n## Page 2\n\nunusual given that in secondaries in Moneybox, GoCardless, Vinted & Revolut, ex\nemployees took part.\n●\nThe sell ask is £13 (16.5$) per share, valuing Monzo at 4.73B$ (£3.7B). That’s a\n20% discount to the secondary, and a 9% to the last primary valuation.\nThe Deal\n●\nWe know Monzo is unlikely to accept such a discount. In fact, their position is\ncurrently blocking all transfers.\n●\nThis is clearly unsustainable. The business is not ready to go public yet — the\nsecondary round is an admission of such.\n●\nProtecting valuations has limits, when there are angry ex employees who need\nliquidity. This is a fight that is winnable.\n●\nRevolut took the same restrictive position on stock transfers, while eventually caving.\n●\nThere are many creative means of negotiating and campaigning for companies to ‘let\nmy people go.’\n●\nMonzo has hired the Ex Nubank CFO, which means it will likely list on the LSE in the\nnext few years. Its numbers are not currently good enough to do so.\n●\nMonzo’s numbers are already likely vastly improved for 2024 to justify the new\nsecondary valuation. Since it has raised over 1.7B$, there should be a discount\nregardless of this, due to the preference.\n●\nIt’s easy to see a world in a few years time where Monzo lists with revenue over $2B,\nand widening net profitability closer to Starling and Revolut, fetching a much higher\nvaluation in the process.\n●\nTo put that journey into perspective, look at Wise. As a public company, it is\ncontinuing to grow at 20%, with profits increasing 55%. Fintechs will continue to\nreduce operating costs with AI agents over time. Wise trades at over 10X revenues,\nwith a Net Profit similar to Starling and Revolut, underscoring the ability for Monzo to\nfetch a strong valuation when it does reach the public markets.\nCleo AI\nWhen the enigmatic Barney Hussey-Yeo founded an AI chatbot for budgeting in 2016, he\ntook the bold step to pivot to the US market. That gamble paid off. Today, Cleo does $150M\nof revenue, with a stronghold in the US, and sights on the UK.\nYou’re likely wondering how a chatbot can win in the era of LLMs, but Barney understood the\nvalue of conversational interfaces way before it went mainstream. Now, with an armada of\nloyal subscribers, Cleo is expanding into building customers’ an alternative credit score and\nproviding credit\n\n\n---\n\n## Page 3\n\n●\nCleo did $65.9M of revenue in 2023, growing that to around 150M$ in 2024,\naccording to a company document. That’s 127% growth.\n●\nThey brought losses down to just over $14M, reaching EBITDA breakeven in\nDecember 2023. For 2024, they will likely generate a significant net profit.\n●\nAround 61% of its revenues come from its three subscription products including\nbudgeting and credit builder, with the rest coming from transaction fees.\n●\nIn 2023, all of its revenue was from the US, with reentrance of the UK on the horizon\nfor 2024.\n●\nYeo cited, higher conversion and utilisation” of its paying products and “improved\nsubscriber retention,” as key drivers of its increasing unit economics’ efficiency.\nValuation\n●\nCleo last raised $83M in 2022 at a $500M valuation. It is unlikely to have to raise\nagain.\n●\nIt does not appear to have raised secondaries, although the founder is angel\ninvesting indicating he may have sold some stock recently.\n●\nDue to the obvious risks of consumer subscription revenue and LLM defensibility,\nthere is opportunity for a discount.\n●\nIt is likely that a deal could be struck at 650-750M$.\n●\nThe founder still owns the business, while there are sellers directly connected with\nthe founder to push the deal through fast.\n●\nThere is a path to an IPO or secondary market growth with expansion of product\nrange, leveraging proprietary data. However, trade acquirers have bought businesses\nlike this before, with Intuit buying Credit Karma for $7B, or Apple buying Credit Kudos\nfor $150M.\nOther Opportunities\n●\nHelsing - German Defence Tech\n●\nMarshmallow - UK Insurtech with over $500M ARR\n\n\n---\n\n",
