Overall 36/100 

slide 
1. ok
2. scoring matrix doesnt appear, also unclear what is justifying these scores, but we don see them
3. 1m revenue and 245 valuation too basic, for revenue, no adjustements made. also the text here is always the same pass 39/100. needs to actually work seems hardcoded. its also a json dump. revenue seems low and no a16z growth adjustment
4. Team slide v good
5. bear bull makes sense but is way too far down you have to scroll. in a powerpoint you do not sscroll. also growth rate accelerates and decelercates with size its never strict '50%yoy" 
6. business analysis fine 
7. pwerm this is a retarded slide with duplicate empty graphs that dont really make sense. need sa complete rethink or deleting
8. breakpoint is fine. still no pro rata and why does it hyave next round 72m at the end of the graph its strange because it ascends 1x 2x 3x . maybe it shouldnt have next round in it
9. again a fake exit scenario dummy slide. where is my cap table wtf
10. dpi sankey failed. shame because ive seen it before
11. follow on empty. this slide needs work or deleting
12. fund reasoning hardcoded really. no actual analusis
13. next round intelligence, seems realistic but why is vauation less than inferred val. why is step up always 1x. doesnt tell us enough too
14. no entry or exit, but it came with a positio size.
15. sources fine

feels like its missing stuff, tells us little, not good enoygh
