Finster AI and Switchee deck feedback.

1. Slide 1- pretty superfluos but harmless i Guess
2. Slide 2 - we have avg and combined valuation this is retarded. doesnt tell us anything. 
3. Slide 3 - done okay with total funding and valaution and revenue is decent. but both should be on the same slide 
4. slide 4 same did okay with valuation and revenue tho, tho both employee counts are nonsense. way too high
5. slide 5 - path to 100m is okay but is too simplistic. the numbers arent in M of dollars and cut off from sisibility on the y axis. also the x axis is basic. also the slide doesnt actually tell us anything
6. slide 6 - not sure why this one has extended to 8 years till but i guess yeah its assuming a lower growth rate which is fair and probably right. the question is where has the exit scenarios slides gone which used to show more a scenario based view. its also not showing anything in a fund context 
7. slide 7 - description is decent. not sure they sell to america tho, think thats default. 
8. slide 8 -same and the confusion between hardware and software --- ie which one is it or both.
9. following these should be more context market sizing tam pincer / its missing
10. slide 9-  fine but doesnt tell us anything should and needs (M$) figures - 
11. slide 10 is nonense it could actually be useful if it showed capital effiency but it doesnt
12. 11 get rid nonsense
12. 12. cap table has wrong data format, no sankey, and the numbers arent detailed enough and dont tell us anything. can we get in, what price, what owenrship, numbers for series a b seed angel jut not detailed enough. it can even be a pie. its not detailed enough harcoded numbers i think
13. slide 13 same again. same numbers which means hardcocded. 
14, graphs not appearing. its supposed to be both on the same chart but it needs proper work
