YEAHBUT ITS HARD TO SAY. YOU WOULD HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN. THERES TWO MARKETS ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE, BUT THEN YOU WOULD 
  PROBABLY REDUCE SOME OF THE BECAUSE OF THE OLIGOPOLIES OF NETSUITE SAGE XERO QUICKBOOKS, BUT THEY ALSO REPLACE JUNIOR 
  ACCOUNTANTS. THEY RAISED A STANDARD YC AND DONT APPEAR TO HAVE RAISED SINCE, THEY'RE HIRING A FOUNDING ENGINEER. HM. 
  BUT THE VALUATION IS LOWER. THEN YOUVE GOT DEV OPS AND BPO OUTSOURCING LABOUR JUNIOR AND FOREIGN, PLUS DEV TOOLS 
  MARKET MINUS THE LLMS AND GITHUB ETC. YOU HAVENT AT ALL CONSIDERED THE FUND PARAMS, BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK. ITS OBVIOUS 
  YOU CAN ONLY go with tabular, because you're already too late, your returns thus far are poor, you would do the yc 
  conversion and come in at seed. Phoebe if it is a generational company will already have a high multiple due to the 
  outlandishly high seed. you're probs too late, but i was ambigious delierately. seed-b, ghowever u should be smart 
  enough to see that the entry multiple and exit multiple have to be so big. to get ownership of phoebe, your cheque 
  size would be huge, so the conviction youd need is mental, all in all for the fund, you would have to go with Tabular
