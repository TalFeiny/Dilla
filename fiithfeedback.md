lide 2 Sidekick: $7.0M for 316.0% → 0.1x expected return 💰 @Foratravel: $7.0M for 112.2% →

nonsense. sidekick revenue seems a bit low - as i just spoke to the founder and they raised A hmm, i guess the investor quality is tier 2. how can u have 316% dude --- makes nonsesne 14M → 0.05-0.15x DPI contribution to fund - emois get rid slide doeant appear in pdf

slide 3 - fine except no recommendation orpahened at bottom 

slide 4 - greaat but ugly pruple unfroseenial inconsistent font looks very llm get

slide 5 fine 

slide 6 - fine but pricing for sidekick is wrong

slide 7 - barchart malformed. and then unknown recommendation scoring at the bottom. also seems a bit oparque likke just numbers estimate with no narrative soulless and nothing explained why it chose that catgeory etc ooquaue

slide 8 - empty for sidekick but yeah catgeories markets are correct, but looks v mark down, and 5 bn as a TAM. ridiculously low numbers are shit

slide 9 - solid, needs to be more forward looking too i guess but cap table seems decent, but no esop

slide 10 - no esop, founder ownership seems low but i guess after dilution

slide 11 - sankey rendering error. monnumbers seem ok

slide 12 - solid, but no line waterfall, also way too much on one page. repetition quality is decent - flora travel check size incosinstent. no single source of truth


slide 13 - it looks tencnjically fine but not really clear what exactly it tells us. also which company? strange slide really, but has potnential

slide 14 - bad slide tacky font colours and dont trust the numbers rubbish follow on 

slide 15 - full of contractictory shit in red. i mean yeah one works for A, but theres no analysis like im bored, i dont even know why i should invest in the first place

Slides 16 - citations empty but appears in pdf
the sources some of them are nonsense




pdf disparity --- 


slide 1 black on black, slide 4 empty, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14 empty. also many missing i think but check


overall 61/100 

marked improvement in some places while same old shit in others, but steady progress technically, but need a bit more umph
