slide 1 - waste of a slide - pdf export ios broken

slide 2 -  i think revenue right isshhhh not sure if ownership correct. why both 0.7X not really good enough. both groiwth rate 150% also wheres pre and post money, why such clean entry cheques 

slide 3 - ok but still no recommendation

slide 4 - fine info wise but still horrible purple and tacky ticks, also xapien has 0/100

slide 5 - fine but we also need time since rounds, and estimated ownership post money  after each diluted round. feel like we have the data. the story isnt being told 

slide 6 . - good but no tam and no prcing for v7

slide 7 - this slide is weak. we get acv and it seems right but this slide needs a rthink. only the acv appears - no rationale. gross margin v low but i guess ai first growth doesnt appear. nthen just emty. ugly green colours. stells us nothing - filler code at bottom 

slide 8 - most markdown looking slide, green and no evidence to numbers, the catgeoriws are fine but no perplexity like citations.  numbers have no evidenc ebase

slide 9 - cool to see the cap table. not sure if numbers are right and not forward looking, doesnt show our potential ownership post also numbers at the text part of the slide empty. 

slide 10 - nice

slide 11 - error rendering sankey 

slide 12 - too much on one slide, slide cuts off for next round. unsure what the probability cloud is actually showing need to clarify - invalid chart structure. need to rethink as too much on a lside 

slide 13 - empty pointless slide, dpi. needs a rethink takes fund context does nothing with it

slide 14 - dogshit slide. think its hardcoded hmmm doesnt have the same style 

slide 15 - shit ui, duplicate with no actual insights. poor

slide 16 - citations empty 


overall 56/100
