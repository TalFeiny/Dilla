Collapsing revenue multiples, rising interest rates, and an unpredictable economy made it hard for companies to go public. Many promising tech companies chose to wait it out, leading to some of the slowest years for IPOs in recent memory. In fact, 2023 and 2024 saw some of the lowest IPO activity in over a decade. [...] But 2025 could be different. With falling interest rates, and market sentiment improving, many of the tech darlings that stayed private are now rumored to be preparing for a public offering. Dozens of tech companies that have been growing behind the scenes might make their public debut. [...] A potential IPO should be exciting for the salespeople at these companies, too. Reps might see financial rewards if they hold options or shares. And going public can boost a company\u2019s reputation and widen its reach, making it easier to attract new clients and close bigger deals.\n\nFrom AI pioneers to fintech disruptors, these companies are positioning themselves to capitalize on renewed investor confidence and a tech-hungry market.\n\n## Top IPO Candidates for 2025",
